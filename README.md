Water flow sensor sender utility
================================

Arduino sketch to send flow rate and total consumption via RF B00 Protocol
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal of this project is to build a water flow sensor that can monitor instantaneous water flow rate and calculate total water consumption and transmit that data wirelessly to a Ninja Block or another Arduino.

The custom B00 protocol is used to handle RF transmission of the sensor data.

For full step-by-step instructions on how to put together the hardware and software, take a look at this project's GitHub Page here:
